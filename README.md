# Explanation(About the GUI)
This is a Java program that simulates an ATM System with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The program includes a main window with a welcome message, three buttons for View Balance, Withdraw Money, and Deposit Money, and a JLabel to display the current balance. The program also includes methods for viewing the current balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The methods are implemented to ensure that the user cannot withdraw more than their current balance and updates the balance accordingly after each transaction. The GUI interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to perform various banking operations.

window with the title "ATM System" will open when you launch the software. The window will have the following four parts:
1. A label at the top of the window that says, "Welcome to the ATM system!"
2. A "View Balance" button that, when pressed, enables the user to see their current balance.
3. A "Withdraw Money" button that, when pressed, enables the user to remove money from their account.
4. A "Deposit Money" button that, when pressed, enables the user to add money to their account.
Simply click one of the buttons to carry out the appropriate activity when using the application.
• A message box displaying the current balance may be seen by clicking "View Balance."
• The user will be prompted to input the desired withdrawal amount after clicking "Withdraw Money." The application will deduct the input amount from the balance and display a message box with the revised balance if the entered amount is less than or equal to the current balance. The application will display an "Insufficient balance!" message box and the balance won't be changed if the input amount exceeds the current balance.
• The user will be prompted to enter a deposit amount after clicking "Deposit Money." The application will increase the balance by the amount entered.
